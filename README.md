# Project: Tic Tac Toe (JavaScript Course)

## About Winner Check Algorithm

Check the board after every move for a winning straight. Done by checking

This is a brute force attempt I can think of at the top of my head. I've also thought of an algorithm that only checks the relevant cells to the currently placed mark, but for the size of the board (3x3), it might not be worth the implementation time. I haven't checked any tic tac toe win check algorithms for the purpose of learning. Will check for an inevitable better algorithm after the project is functioning.
